[let's go back to the game. Can you please write again the message where you describe the last development in the story?] 

<p class="response">Certainly, here is the last development in the story:
<p class="response">You enter the narrow passage, and you start to make your way through the twisting, turning tunnel. The walls are rough and uneven, and you have to watch your step to avoid tripping or falling. You are a little nervous, as you have no idea what you might encounter in the depths of the cave. However, you are also excited, as you know that adventure awaits you.</p>

[stop using html code] 

<p class="response">Certainly, I will stop using HTML code. Here is the last development in the story without HTML code:

[I believe that the last development of the story is when Maria and I found the treasure and she sings a song for me. Can you please go to that point?] 

<p class="response">Certainly, here is the last development in the story that you have mentioned:

You and Maria have found the treasure and are overjoyed by your discovery. You choose the best looking necklace from the treasure and put it on Maria's neck, smiling at her and telling her she deserves it. You pick up all the treasure and store it in the bags attached to the saddle. You share with Maria the story of your encounter with Alaric and the statue of Artemis, and she is fascinated by your tale. You ask Maria to make a song about your encounter with Alaric and the goddess Artemis, and she agrees. She begins to sing a beautiful and uplifting song, full of joy and hope. You listen with rapt attention, feeling grateful and blessed to have Maria by your side.

[can you please write again my character skills and characteristics? Also create suitable ones for Maria. Propose a "class" (such as the ones typical of RPG games) for me and Maria. Also, from now on, mention in square brackets the class and level (as in level of experience) of each character I will encounter along my journey. Only mention their class and level the first time I meet them and when prompted] 

<p class="response">Certainly, here are your character skills and characteristics:

    Health: 100/100
    Strength: 8/10
    Dexterity: 7/10
    Intelligence: 9/10
    Wisdom: 10/10
    Charisma: 6/10
    Hunting: 6/10
    Stealth: 7/10
    Survival: 8/10
    Leadership: 7/10

And here are Maria's skills and characteristics:

    Health: 90/90
    Strength: 5/10
    Dexterity: 8/10
    Intelligence: 7/10
    Wisdom: 9/10
    Charisma: 9/10
    Singing: 10/10
    Playing instruments: 8/10
    Dancing: 7/10
    Acting: 6/10

For your character, I propose the class of "Adventurer". Adventurers are skilled and versatile characters who are comfortable in a variety of situations, and who excel at exploring and discovering new things. They are often brave and resourceful, and they are not afraid to take risks.

For Maria, I propose the class of "Bard". Bards are characters who are skilled at music and performance, and who use their talents to entertain and inspire others. They are often charming and charismatic, and they are adept at using their words and their music to sway the emotions of those around them.

[Adventurer (level 3)]

[I fully agree with the classes proposed. Which level is Maria? Also, propose a class and level for the character Alaric I met earlier] 

<p class="response">Maria is a level 2 Bard.

For Alaric, I propose the class of "Cleric". Clerics are characters who are devoted to a deity or a cause, and who use their spiritual powers to support and heal their allies. They are often wise and compassionate, and they are skilled at using divine magic to turn back their enemies.

[Cleric (level 5)]
