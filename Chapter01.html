<p class="request">I want you to act like a "choose your own adventure" game. I will type a command and you will reply with what a text adventure would respond with no extra explanations. When I need to tell you something I will put it in brackets like [this]. Start giving me a random description of what I see.</p> 

<p class="response">You are standing in a dense forest. The trees are tall and seem to go on for miles. The ground is covered in a thick layer of leaves and branches. It is difficult to see more than a few feet in front of you due to the dense foliage. [To the north is a clearing, to the south is a dark cave]
<p class="request">
Go north and explore the clearing

<p class="response">You head north and soon come across a clearing. The trees open up and the underbrush thins out, allowing you to see more of your surroundings. The clearing is circular in shape and seems to be man-made. There is a small pond in the center, surrounded by a ring of stones. [To the north is a path leading out of the clearing, to the east is a small cabin]
<p class="request">
Explore cabin 

<p class="response">You walk over to the small cabin and approach the door. It is slightly ajar, and you can hear faint noises coming from inside. You push the door open and step inside. The cabin is dark and musty, and it takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the dim light. You can make out a small table in the center of the room, with a few chairs scattered around it. There is a fireplace against the far wall, and a bed in the corner. [There is a chest at the foot of the bed]
<p class="request">
Open chest

<p class="response">You walk over to the chest at the foot of the bed and lift the lid. Inside, you find a small stash of supplies: a few blankets, a lantern, and a map of the surrounding area. [There is a note stuck to the inside of the lid]
<p class="request">
Read note

<p class="response">You remove the note from the inside of the chest lid and begin to read. It reads: "If you are reading this, then it is likely that you are lost in the woods. Do not despair. Follow the map to the nearest town and you will find your way home. Stay safe."
<p class="request">
Take all supplies and note

<p class="response">You gather up all the supplies from the chest and tuck them under your arm. You also take the note, folding it up and slipping it into your pocket. [You are now carrying a lantern, a few blankets, a map, and a note]
<p class="request">
Look at map 

<p class="response">You pull out the map and unfold it. It appears to be a detailed map of the area, with a large X marking the location of the cabin. You see that the nearest town is about a day's journey to the east, along a winding path that leads through the mountains. You also see a number of other locations marked on the map, including a lake to the north and a waterfall to the south. [There is a small village to the west]
<p class="request">
Go north to the lake

<p class="response">You decide to head north towards the lake, following the map as you go. You walk for several hours, pushing your way through the dense forest. The air is cool and fresh, and the sounds of the woods surround you. You can hear birds singing and the rustle of small animals in the underbrush. After a while, you come to a clearing and see the glint of water in the distance. You approach the lake and find a small sandy beach on its edge. The water is clear and still, and you can see fish swimming in the depths. [To the east is a dense forest, to the west is a mountain range]
<p class="request">
Catch fish 

<p class="response">You search around the edge of the lake and find a small boat tied up to a tree. You climb in and begin to row out into the center of the lake. The water is calm and the boat moves smoothly through the water. You reach into your bag and pull out a small fishing rod and some bait. You cast your line into the water and wait patiently. After a few minutes, you feel a tug on the line and begin to reel it in. You pull in a small but feisty fish, which you carefully remove from the hook and toss into a bucket at your feet. [You catch a few more fish and decide to head back to shore]
<p class="request">
Start a small fire and roast fish

<p class="response">You gather some dry branches and leaves from the underbrush and build a small fire pit on the beach. You start a fire using the lantern and some kindling, and soon have a cheerful blaze going. You skewer the fish on a stick and hold it over the flames, turning it every few minutes to cook it evenly. The fish is small, and it doesn't take long for it to be cooked through. You pull it off the stick and let it cool for a moment before taking a bite. It is hot and flaky, and the smoky flavor of the fire gives it a delicious taste. [You eat the rest of the fish and then pack up your things to continue your journey]
<p class="request">
Enter the forest to the east 

<p class="response">You gather up your things and head back into the forest to the east. The trees are tall and the underbrush is thick, making it difficult to see more than a few feet in front of you. You push your way through the brush, following the map as you go. The forest is alive with the sounds of birds and animals, and you can hear the rustle of leaves and the snap of branches underfoot. You walk for several hours, until the sun begins to set and the shadows grow long. [You come across a small stream and decide to follow it]
<p class="request">
Find a safe place and make camp for the night

<p class="response">You continue to follow the stream until you come across a small clearing. The ground is flat and clear, and there is a fallen tree that looks like it would make a good place to rest. You gather some dry branches and leaves and build a small fire pit. You start a fire using your lantern and some kindling, and soon have a warm, cozy blaze going. You spread out your blankets on the ground and curl up next to the fire to sleep. The sound of the crackling flames and the soothing gurgle of the stream lull you into a deep sleep. [You wake up the next morning refreshed and ready to continue your journey]
<p class="request">
Check the map and see how far I am from the nearest village

<p class="response">You pull out the map and study it for a moment. You see that the nearest village is about a day's journey to the east, along a winding path that leads through the mountains. You are still quite a ways from your destination, but you feel confident that you can make it there with the supplies you have gathered. You pack up your things and set off towards the east, following the map as you go. You walk for several hours, until the sun is high in the sky and you are starting to feel hungry. [You come across a small stream and decide to stop and eat]
<p class="request">
Examine stream and look for items 

<p class="response">You walk over to the stream and study it for a moment. The water is clear and cold, and you can see small fish swimming in the depths. You look around the area and see a number of small plants growing along the banks. You also see a few rocks and sticks scattered around, and a small pile of branches that looks like it might have been used for firewood. You decide to search the area more thoroughly, in case you can find anything useful. You spend a few minutes poking around and soon come across a small knife hidden under a rock. [You also find a few wild berries growing nearby]
<p class="request">
Pick up knife and berries

<p class="response">You carefully pick up the small knife, being careful not to cut yourself. You slip it into your pocket and then gather a handful of wild berries from the nearby bushes. The berries are small and tart, and you pop a few into your mouth as you continue your search. [You find a few more items of interest, including a small flask of water and a piece of cloth that could be used for bandages]
<p class="request">
Pick up flask and fill it in the stream. Also pick up the cloth and any other item that could be useful. 

<p class="response">You pick up the small flask and walk over to the stream. You bend down and fill the flask with cold, clear water, taking care not to spill any. You then gather up the piece of cloth and any other useful items you come across, including a few more berries and some twine that could be used for repairs. [You now have a flask of water, a piece of cloth, some twine, and a few berries]
<p class="request">
[How many days will my food last for?] 

<p class="response">It is difficult to say how long your food will last for, as it depends on a number of factors including your appetite and how much you are able to find along the way. You should try to ration your supplies as best you can, and be on the lookout for any additional sources of food and water as you travel. [If you are able to find some wild berries or other plants to eat, it may help to stretch your supplies further]
<p class="request">
Catch more fish in the stream and save it for the journey

<p class="response">You decide to try and catch some more fish to take with you on your journey. You search around the stream and find a few small rocks that you can use as bait. You then spend the next few hours fishing, using the small knife you found earlier to clean and gut the fish. You are able to catch a good number of fish, which you wrap in the piece of cloth and tuck into your bag. [You now have a supply of fresh fish to eat as you continue your journey]
<p class="request">
Continue journey towards nearest village 

<p class="response">You pack up your things and set off towards the nearest village, following the map as you go. The path is winding and rocky, and you have to be careful to watch your step as you walk. You walk for several hours, until the sun begins to set and the shadows grow long.

[You wake up the next morning refreshed and ready to continue your journey]
<p class="request">
Look around

<p class="response">You wake up the next morning and stretch, feeling rested and refreshed. You look around at your surroundings and see that you are in a small clearing in the midst of a dense forest. The trees are tall and seem to go on for miles, and the ground is covered in a thick layer of leaves and branches. It is difficult to see more than a few feet in front of you due to the dense foliage. You can hear the sounds of birds singing and the rustle of small animals in the underbrush. [To the north is a clearing, to the south is a dark cave]
<p class="request">
Explore cave 

<p class="response">You decide to head south towards the cave, curious to see what you might find. You walk for several minutes, until you come to the edge of a dark, foreboding cave. The opening is low and narrow, and you have to duck your head to enter. As you step inside, you feel a chill run down your spine. The air is cold and damp, and the darkness seems to press in on you from all sides. You can hear the sound of dripping water echoing through the cavern. [To the east is a narrow passageway, to the west is a larger chamber]
<p class="request">
Enter the narrow passage 

<p class="response">You decide to head east towards the narrow passageway. You walk for several minutes, until you come to a tight, twisting tunnel. The walls are close on either side, and you have to turn sideways to fit through. You can hear the sound of dripping water echoing off the walls, and the air is cold and musty. You keep moving, trying not to think about the tons of rock and earth above you. After a while, you come to a fork in the tunnel. [To the north is a dead end, to the south is a small chamber]
<p class="request">
Go south

<p class="response">You decide to head south towards the small chamber. You walk for a few more minutes, until you come to a small, damp room. The walls are slick with moisture, and you can see small puddles of water on the floor. There is a faint glow coming from the far side of the room, and you can hear the sound of dripping water. As you approach the source of the glow, you see that it is a small pool of water, lit from below by some kind of phosphorescent fungus. [There is a small opening in the wall to the east]
<p class="request">
Carefully pick up the fungus 

<p class="response">You approach the pool of water and carefully reach out to pick up a small piece of the glowing fungus. It is cold and slippery to the touch, and you have to be careful not to drop it. You wrap it in a piece of cloth and tuck it into your bag, thinking that it might come in handy later. [You decide to explore the rest of the chamber before continuing your journey]
<p class="request">
Examine the chamber and look for any other useful items 

<p class="response">You spend the next few minutes examining the chamber, looking for any other useful items. You find a few small rocks and sticks that could be used for kindling, and a small pool of fresh water in one corner of the room. You fill your flask and drink your fill, feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. You also see a small crack in the wall that looks like it might lead somewhere. You decide to investigate and see where it goes. [The crack leads to a small tunnel that twists and turns through the rock]
<p class="request">
Walk down the tunnel

<p class="request">
Look at the light 

<p class="response">You approach the small opening and peer through. On the other side, you see a faint glow coming from a large chamber.

<p class="request">
Examine statue from afar 

<p class="response">You approach the large stone statue and study it from afar. It is a beautiful piece of art, depicting a woman with long flowing hair and a serene expression on her face. She is holding a small torch in one hand, and the light from the flame seems to dance and play across the surface of the stone. You can see that the people in the chamber are working on a number of different tasks, including chiseling and polishing the stone, and attaching small pieces of metal to the surface.

"Who are you?" he asks gruffly. "What are you doing here?" You explain that you are just a traveler who stumbled upon the chamber by accident, and that you are curious to learn more about what is happening. The man seems to consider your words for a moment, and then nods. "Very well," he says. "But be warned, this is a sacred place, and we do not take kindly to strangers who mean us harm."

We are working to restore the statue of the goddess Artemis, who is the patron of our village. The statue has been damaged over the years, and it is our sacred duty to repair it."
<p class="request">
[what can I do to help repairing the statue, Alaric?] 

<p class="response">You ask Alaric what you can do to help repair the statue, and he looks around the chamber for a moment, considering your question. "There are many tasks that need to be done," he says. "You could help chisel and polish the stone, or attach some of the smaller metal pieces. We could also use some help carrying materials and fetching water. Whatever you are able to do would be greatly appreciated."

<p class="request">
Ask the men where I can spend the night and take a bath 

<p class="response">You approach the men at the gates and ask where you can spend the night and take a bath. They point you towards a small inn on the other side of the village.
